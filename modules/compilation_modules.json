    "content": "This video contains multiple distinct segments, each featuring a separate restaurant, food item, or experience. Your task is to:\n\n1. **Detect all individual entries** (e.g., each restaurant, or place to go, or dish in a list or whatever other catagory listed in another module).\n2. **For each entry**, apply all relevant modules (e.g., `restaurant_core`, `dish_details`, `ambiance`, etc.).\n3. Structure your output so that each segment is treated independently, with its own extracted metadata.\n\nReturn the results as a list of extracted objects, one per segment, using the full stack of applicable food modules.",
